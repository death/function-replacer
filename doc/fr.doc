1. Overview
------------
From the logs:

<wolf1> can ya help me more with that dll editing :)
<AB4DS> what's the problem
<wolf1> k well the replacing worked of course
<wolf1> but im having trouble finding the area in dll of the actual
        function.. maybe there is some easier way to do it
<wolf1> like specify only that function i need from different dll
...
<wolf1> wish there was some editor to let u do it
<AB4DS> I have an idea
<AB4DS> ;)
<wolf1> killer
<AB4DS> I could code something that would replace ANY function in a DLL..

Well, here it is :)
This programme will replace any export from a DLL with another DLL's export,
it performs an automatic loading of the DLL + getting the function's
address, then calling it. Could be useful sometimes.

3. What to do?
---------------
Well, it's pretty easy to understand the programme. You should understand
it yourself :). (lazy!)

Few things to remember:

    - This tool wasn't properly tested, backup your DLLs.
    - The tool modifies EAX just before it calls the new function.
    - You cannot use the same API in the new function (unless you want a
      recursive function ;)
    - The old function won't run.
    - You must have the same number of parameters in the NEW function as
      well as the old one.
    - The function must be bigger than the loading code/data.. The size
      of this may vary, but most functions will do (100 bytes is enough).


4. Technical notes
-------------------
Well I coded this tool in two days.. One day for the main engine, the
other day for the GUI. The tool was coded in C. Some stuff were recycled
from VBRef.
